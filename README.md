# Type Error in TypeScript function parameter
This example demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a string argument, but an array of strings is passed.  The compiler will correctly flag this as an error.

The solution involves ensuring that the correct type is passed to the function, which might involve iterating over the array or using a different function signature.
